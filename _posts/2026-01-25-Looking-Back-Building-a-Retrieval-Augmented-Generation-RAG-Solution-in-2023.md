This RAG project started as a simple side experiment with my colleague Brian Paskin back in *2023*. What began as a small weekend curiosity quickly revealed how Retrieval-Augmented-Generation can help mitigate some of the short comings of Large Language Models at the time

Technology moves fast - we’re way past the cycle of 2023.  While RAG isn’t new anymore, this project showed me how powerful a lightweight generative AI solution can still meaningfully improve team efficiency and productivity.

This post is less about technical architecture and more about the learning experience—what it felt like to build my first AI side project.
