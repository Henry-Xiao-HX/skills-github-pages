I recently had the privilege of leading a hands-on workshop with a financial services client, focusing on Data Intelligence and Data Quality. Some reflections: 

As part of the workshop, we: 

- Leveraged watsonx.data Intelligence to establish a governed data foundation and automate data stewardship and curation tasks. 
- Applied out-of-the-box and custom data quality rules to manage data quality at enterprise scale. 
- Enriched metadata with financial services-specific business glossary to drive consistent understanding across the organization. 
- Explored governance workflows for quality remediation and data access, ensuring compliance with enterprise business rules and standards. 

Why are we doing this: In both today’s rapidly evolving AI landscape and in traditional business processes, one principle remains constant: bad data in, bad data out. Ensuring your data is of high quality - accurate, complete, timely, consistent, and fit for purpose - is integral for operational excellence and achieving/maintaining competitive edge. 

Excited to keep driving these conversations and helping organizations turn raw data into strategic/actionable insights.
