As AI adoption accelerates in the financial industry, these trends underscore the necessity for robust data governance frameworks (GDPR, BCBS 239, etc) and the tools that support compliance with these frameworks. 

A core principle of BCBS 239 is the ability to track the full data flow behind a metric, especially when it involves sensitive information or PII. Without clear insight into data lineage and data ownership, organizations face significant risks - including regulatory non-compliance and the uncontrolled exposure of sensitive data to AI models.
