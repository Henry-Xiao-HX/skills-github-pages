I recently had the privilege of leading a hands-on workshop with a financial services client, focusing on Data Intelligence and Data Quality. As organizations accelerate their AI initiatives and incorporate AI worklows into their operational processes, the demand for trusted, governed, high‑quality data has never been higher.

# Highlights: 

✔️ Leveraged watsonx.data Intelligence to establish a governed data foundation and automate data stewardship and curation tasks. 

✔️ Applied out-of-the-box and custom data quality rules to manage data quality at enterprise scale. 

✔️ Enriched metadata with financial services-specific business glossary to drive consistent understanding across the organization. 

✔️ Explored governance workflows for quality remediation and data access, ensuring compliance with enterprise business rules and standards. 


# Why This Work Matters
In both today’s rapidly evolving AI landscape and in traditional business processes, one principle remains constant: bad data in, bad data out. Ensuring your data is of high quality - accurate, complete, timely, consistent, and fit for purpose - is integral for operational excellence and achieving/maintaining competitive edge. 

# Looking Ahead
I’m excited to continue these conversations and support organizations as they transform raw data into strategic, actionable insights.
