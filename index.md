# Hello! 
My name is Henry Xiao, and I’ve been part of IBM since 2023.

In my role, I focus on helping financial services organizations adopt and accelerate Data and AI solutions: from modernizing data architectures to implementing AI capabilities that drive operational efficiency, strengthen risk management, and support regulatory compliance. 

On this platform, I look forward to sharing insights from the evolving AI landscape, practical guidance on working with IBM’s Data and AI offerings, and learnings from real-world engagements across financial services.

Cheers!

**P.S.** Outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic home cook - because building good Data & AI foundations is important, but crafting a good meal is a non‑negotiable.
